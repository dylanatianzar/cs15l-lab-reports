This is a tutorial on how to remotely access UCSD computers.
Let's start by looking up the course-specific `ieng6` account by going to this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

Submit your credentials in these boxes:

Then, there should be a button that says **cs15lwi23xxx** or similar. The *xxx* being letters specific to you.
This is your account name for remote access. If you've forgotten your password, learn how to reset it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit).
